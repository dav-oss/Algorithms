# DS And Algorithms
## Arrays
fixed-size collection of similar data items stored in contiguous memory locations. It can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, char, float, etc., and also derived and user-defined data types such as pointers, structures, etc.
## Linked List 
A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Where, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
# Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it

# Queue
A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue for a train station, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.
